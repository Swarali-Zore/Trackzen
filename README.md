# üß† TrackZen ‚Äì All-in-One Productivity App

**TrackZen** is a personal productivity companion, built to manage everything in one place ‚Äî tasks, notes, and workouts. I always found it frustrating to switch between different apps just to stay organized, so created this all-in-one tool to simplify it.

With TrackZen, you can:
- Manage daily tasks üóÇÔ∏è
- Write and save notes üìù
- Track your home workouts üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- Monitor your productivity over time üìä

## üí° Why TrackZen?

Most of us use separate apps for to-dos, notes, and fitness tracking. It becomes messy and hard to stay focused. TrackZen solves this by bringing everything together in a single dashboard that's clean and easy to use.
